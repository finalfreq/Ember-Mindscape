#MindScape

MindScape is a tool for the community. It is an open format forum board where users can ask a question, and then another user can post a response to those questions. This app was created using Ember.js.

## Usage

To use the app run
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
Navigate in your browser to localhost:8000.

From the main page you can see any questions that have been posted, add a new question, go to the newly created question page and create answers for those questions. There is also built in functionality to be able to edit and delete answers as well as delete questions.
