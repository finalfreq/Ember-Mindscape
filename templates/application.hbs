EmberJS Code Review
Your project:

For this project, you will make a question and answer message board. The idea is that a user can submit a question and other users can respond with answers.

Here are the features to include:

List out all of the questions that users have asked on the main page, with just the question and the name of the author.
Allow users to add, edit and delete questions. Question properties should include question, author and description.
Let users click on a question to see all of the question properties.
Allow users to add answers for a question. Answers should be added and viewed on the same page as the question they respond to.
Allow users to delete answers.
Important note: To ensure that you are using compatible lib files, match the lib folder from the Blogger repo.

Your code will be reviewed for the following objectives:

Use the application template to wrap all of your pages
Store data using models and Ember Data
Manipulate data between models and templates using controllers
Complete a working Ember app
After your final review, submit your repo link to the Ember Code Review on Epicenter.
